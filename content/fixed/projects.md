### Untitled for the moment

As part of my Honours project, I developed several Python routines for analysing numerical simulation data obtained from the PLUTO simulation package. I am in the process of polishing my Python code so that I can release it as a standalone analysis library. Highlights will include:

* Simplified loading of PLUTO data files
* The projection of spherical data onto a Cartesian grid (2D)
* The calculation of simulation energetics
* The calculation of luminosity for each grid cell
* The production of simulated surface brightness distributions
* The production of movies from a simulation for various variables: density, pressure, luminosity etc.

### Turnt Ninja / Substructio

[Turnt Ninja](https://github.com/opcon/turnt-ninja) is cross-platform open-source, GPLv3 licensed, procedurally generated music/rhythm game inspired by the wonderful Super Hexagon.
Turnt Ninja is written in C#, and uses the [Substructio library](https://github.com/opcon/substructio) for reusable code.

### QuickFont

[QuickFont](https://github.com/opcon/quickfont) is a cross-platform text rendering library for OpenTK.
The original version developed by James Lohr is no longer maintained, and I maintain the newer version of the library.

### Gwen.NET

[Gwen.NET](https://github.com/opcon/gwen-nolegacy-opentk-renderer) is a cross-platform GUI library for OpenTK.
Originally developed by Garry Newman and others, I maintain a version that relies on QuickFont for text rendering and uses modern OpenGL functionality.

### Cync

[Cync](https://github.com/opcon/cync) is a music synchronization application designed to be used with portable media players that have multiple storage drives, such as internal storage + a microSD card.
Cync will sync playlists across multiple storage drives, ensuring that the multiple storage drives are used efficiently.
