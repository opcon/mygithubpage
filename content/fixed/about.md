I am Patrick Yates. I am passionate about Science and Technology, and am currently studying Astrophysics at the University of Tasmania.
I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science (Hons.) in Astrophysics, where I used numerical hydrodynamic simulations to study restarting radio jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

In addition to my studies and research, I enjoy programming, and have developed and/or maintain a number of open-source libraries and programs.
The most notable include QuickFont, a text renderer for OpenTK, and Turnt Ninja, a music/rhythm game inspired by Super Hexagon.

My cv is available here: [cv](/download/cv-web.pdf).
