My research interests are in Astrophysics.
My honours project involved developing a method for running numerical simulations of restarting radio jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).
The results from these simulations were analysed to determine how recurrent jet activity affected both the energetics and dynamics of the radio jets.

A draft copy of my Honours thesis is available for download here: [honours-thesis.pdf](/download/honours-thesis.pdf).

A poster that I presented at the **conference name here** conference is available for download here: **add link in here**

From the numerical simulations I was able to create several movies illustrating the restarting nature of the jet, a selection of which are shown below.
